Instant banana mix (now without eggs!)

INSTRUCTIONS 
Take all of these files and add them to a new folder in your blender 4.0 scripts folder named "Banana For Scale"
*IMPORTANT* If you dont place it there or name it correctly this will not work
*IMPORTANT* If you know how to make this script work without naming the folder exactly "Banana For Scale" shoot me a message!

Then install the addon like a legacy addon
