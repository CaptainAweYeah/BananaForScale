# BananaForScale
Instant banana mix (now without eggs!)

(exclusively for blender 4.0!)
INSTRUCTIONS 
Take all of these files and add them to a new folder in your blender 4.0 addons folder named "Banana For Scale"
*IMPORTANT* If you dont place it there or name it correctly this will not work
*IMPORTANT* If you know how to make this script work without naming the folder exactly "Banana For Scale" shoot me a message!

Then install the addon like a legacy addon

*ISSUES I AM AWARE OF SO FAR*
(feel free to help me fix these)
specifying the path has been confusing for me for some reason, so i've hardcoded the path following the cwd (this is why it only works for blender 4.0)
I'm not sure how to check if the object is currently linked, so you get an error every time you move the banana
